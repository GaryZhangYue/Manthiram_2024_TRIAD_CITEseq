# Manthiram_2024_TRIAD_CITEseq Bioinformatics Analysis Scripts

This repository contains bioinformatics analysis scripts used in the **Manthiram_2024_TRIAD_CITEseq** project. The scripts cover preprocessing, clustering, differential expression analysis, and various downstream analyses, including TCR and BCR analysis.

## Inventory

### Script 01: Preprocessing, Integration, and Clustering of GEX Data
- Preprocessing gene expression (GEX) data, integration, and clustering of cells.

### Script 02: Cell Type Annotation
- Annotating cell types based on Azimuth label transferring, clustering results and marker gene expression.

### Script 03: Myeloid Cell Subpopulation Reclustering
- Reclustering of myeloid cell subpopulations for more granular analysis.

### Script 04: Myeloid Cell Subpopulation Analysis
- In-depth analysis of myeloid cell subpopulations, including marker gene expression.

### Script 05: Cell Frequency Analysis
- Analysis of cell frequencies across different samples or conditions.

### Script 06: Differential Expression Analysis
- **Note**: Differential expression analysis utilizing MAST. This process is time-consuming, and slurm arrays were applied for parallel processing to accelerate the workflow.

### Script 07: GSEA Analysis
- Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).

### Script 08: DEG Volcano Plots and GSEA Dotplots
- Visualization of DEGs using volcano plots and GSEA results using dotplots.

### Script 09: Functional Score Calculation and Plots
- Calculation of functional scores and generation of corresponding plots.

### Script 10: TCR Analysis
- Analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) data.

### Script 11: BCR Analysis
- Analysis of B-cell receptor (BCR) data.
